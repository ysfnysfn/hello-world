# hello-world
The beginning
Hi, I'm SharonS, new to GitHub

Just beginning to learn something about data science in medical care

Hope I can do something interesting and useful someday

Binge on coffee, love painting, huge fan of Asimov

So, what else do you want to know about me?

Feeling like writing a message in a drift bottle now

Expect to meet you somewhere in the ocean of data
